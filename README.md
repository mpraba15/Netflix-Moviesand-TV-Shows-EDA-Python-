Netflix Movies and TV Shows - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1.	Dataset Overview:
The project would likely begin by loading the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, which typically includes data on titles, genres, release dates, ratings, cast, countries, and more. The dataset is used for understanding patterns, trends, and insights in Netflix content.
## 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data formats.

o	Data Transformation: Converting data into a usable format, such as parsing release dates into separate year, month, and day columns.

o	Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize trends. Common visualizations include bar charts for genre distribution, line plots for release trends over time, or heatmaps for correlations between different variables.

o	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to help in better understanding or to support further analysis.

## 3.	Insights:
o	Top Movies/TV Shows by Ratings: Identifying which titles have the highest or lowest ratings.

o	Content by Country: Analyzing how many movies and TV shows are available in different countries.

o	Genre Trends: Exploring which genres are most popular or have been growing over time.

o	Release Date Trends: Understanding when Netflix releases the most content.
## 4.	Advanced Analysis:
The project may also involve applying more advanced statistical or machine learning techniques, such as clustering to group similar types of shows or using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the descriptions of movies and TV shows.
## 5.	Code Implementation:
o	Libraries: Python libraries such as Pandas (for data manipulation), NumPy (for numerical operations), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations), and possibly Scikit-learn (if any machine learning models are used).

o	Functions: Writing functions for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data.
## Example Insights You Might Find:
•	The number of movies and TV shows on Netflix across various genres.

•	The most common release years for content.

•	The average rating of content on Netflix across different genres or countries.

•	Insights on how the availability of certain types of content (e.g., documentaries, animated shows) has changed over time.
